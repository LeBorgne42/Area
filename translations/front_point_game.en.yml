title: 'Goal of the game'
desc: '2025, an asteroid <span class="text-rouge">hits the Earth</span> with full force in South America creating a chain of natural disasters. After some difficult weeks, the worst seems to be over.<br><br>But suddenly the dead begin to rise among the rubble and nothing seems to stop them. With the panic fading, the armies of each country begin to roll back these hordes of ghosts. But the dead don’t seem to behave <span class="text-rouge">"normally"</span> They seem to move in a coordinated fashion, and some scientists hypothesize an <span class="text-rouge">Alpha zombie</span> in control of the hordes.<br><br>But we don’t know more. For in parallel with the fight against these hordes, the leaders of several nations have launched space programs to give the human race a new chance in other galaxies. This is how we find ourselves on the edge of the universe in an unknown Galaxy rebuilding our civilization.<br><br>Three political regimes survived the exodus: Democracy, Communism and Fascism. Will they be able to live in harmony in this new galaxy or <span class="text-rouge">will they fight</span> for the best planets and resources? The future is not written. One thing for sure, we do not know if the Earth still holds, but it would seem in any case that the <span class="text-rouge">Zombie threat</span> is not an unpleasant memory ... How did they follow us ?!'
